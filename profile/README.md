## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to TYS, an interactive learning resource focused on systems thinking and systems engineering. In a world of abundant intelligence, systems thinking is becoming more important than ever. This site aims to help you understand complex systems, their interactions, and how to design and manage them effectively. Because optimizing individual parts in isolation rarely makes the whole work reliably, TYS equips you to cultivate the coherence that turns many smart pieces into one resilient system.
